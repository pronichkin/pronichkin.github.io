    <h1>Tools manifesto</h1>
    <h2>TL;DR</h2>
    <p>
        The below requirements are based on my experience working with several
        security-cautions customers, such as banks or government agencies across
        the world.
    </p>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        When supporting customers or working with commercial support organizations
        on behalf of customers, it's quite common to be asked for running a
        certain tool to troubleshoot or gather logs. It sounds very easy for
        support people, and hence they tend to &ldquo;overrequest"&rdquo;&mdash;
        that is, ask for using more tools than needed at this point.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, not all tools are create equal, and some of them might be
        difficult to run in certain environment&mdash;especially when it's fairly
        locked down. While certainly possible, request
        to run such tools might delay troubleshooting significantly, because it
        would require to change production system configuration (e.g. include
        specific binary into whitelisting policy.) Hence, we should avoid such
        tools (that is, the tools which fail to comply with the requirements
        provided below)&mdash;unless absolutely necessary and reasonable to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm not saying that each and every customer would impose the constraints
        listed below. In fact, most of the customers would not, or maybe they
        will have only one or two of these requirements. However, the list below
        is meant to be comprehensive and failsafe&mdash;that is, if you succeed
        to comply with all of these requirements, you can be confident your tool
        won't face any obstacles and can be recommended for broad use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Last but not least, these requirements are not specific to troubleshooting
        or diagnostic tools. I mention those types of tools first because I have
        personally been bitten by this before many times. When you have a problem
        and call for support, the last thing you want is to be asked to run a
        tool that you cannot easily run. However, the below requirements are
        in fact universal and can (or even should) be applied to any tools or
        utilities that
        we expect customers to run&mdash;such as monitoring, hardware configuration,
        audit assessment, system deployment and configuration, etc.
