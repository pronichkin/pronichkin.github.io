        <h2 id="History">
            A brief (yes, brief) history of Server Core manageability
        </h2>
        <p>
            You may be new to Server Core, and I will forgive you. Server Core 
            has only been here for 12 years. It has debuted in Windows Server
            2008, released in February 2008 (let alone beta versions.)
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea behind Server Core has always been to provide a minimalistic,
            stripped-down, purposefully built server operating system. It contains
            &ldquo;just enough&rdquo; to run your typical server 
            workload&mdash;such
            as a database system, a network service or a Hyper-converged
            infrastructure (HCI.) It does not include a desktop user environment
            such as Start menu, taskbar, file explorer, etc. This makes Server 
            Core a poor choice for some workloads such as Remote desktop services
            (formerly known as Terminal services) or legacy software where 
            application compatibility is a concern.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this reason, many customers felt in love with Server Core, and 
            some others tend to avoid it. Historically, the most professional
            and savvy administrators appreciated Server Core for small size, 
            flexibility, faster deployment and reduced attack surface. Additionally,
            the limitations of local user interface are often seen as a benefit 
            because it is less prone to human error and prevents <em>configuration
            drift</em> over time, since it encourages remote management at scale
            and automation.
            In fact, Microsoft <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2012/WSV309">
            declared</a> Server Core the default and recommended installation
            option for Windows Server since 2012.
            (<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2008-R2-and-2008/ee941130(v=ws.10)">And</a>
            we 
            <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/MDC-B339">have</a>
            been
            <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2013/C9-17">quite</a>
            persistent
            <a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windowsserver/en-US/85472731-f9ff-4971-a8d8-182f87dbd6ea/best-practices-analyzer-recommends-server-core-server-2012-build-9200>about</a>
            it
            <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/windowsserver/2018/07/05/server-core-and-server-with-desktop-which-one-is-best-for-you/">sunce</a>
            then.
            <a href="https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/windowsserver/2019/10/03/windows-admin-center-unleashes-server-core-adoption/">Really</a>.)
        </p>
        <p>
            On the flip side, less experienced administrators or IT generalists
            often found Server Core confusing and not intuitive enough. The primary
            way to configure and troubleshoot Server Core has always been command
            line&mdash;at least until you set up functional networking connection 
            and some sort of authentication (preferably via Active Directory.)
            Yes, there are options to avoid command line completely. For instance,
            one could use Answer files (aka &ldquo;unattend.xml&rdquo;) or System
            Center for OS deployment and initial configuration. But these come at
            additional cost&mdash;in terms of professional experience, licensing
            money, or both. For this reason, shortly after the very first release
            of Server Core in Windows Server 2008, it formed a niche for various
            friendly local configuration tools. Among which,
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080403001129/http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/guyt/archive/2008/03/22/windows-server-core-coreconfigurator-to-the-rescue.aspx">CoreConfigurator</a>
            happened to be the first one. Several
            <a href="https://petri.com/manage-server-2008-r2-core-with-visual-core-configurator">other
            similar tools</a> followd quickly. And
            <a href="https://4sysops.com/archives/review-smartx-coreconfigurator">some
            of them</a> even had commercial versions!
        </p>
        <p>
            And yes, Server Core in Windows Server 2008 was originally released
            with a new inbox configuration tool, a small script creatively named
            &ldquo;SCregedit.wsf&rdquo;. It offered some basic features like
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/server-core/server-core-servicing#patch-server-core-automatically-with-windows-update">configuring
            Windows update</a> and
            <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/555964">enabling
            Remote Desktop</a>, but also exposed some very niche  settings like
            IPsec or DNS SRV record configuration for domain controllers. Heck,
            it even came with a built-in list of other helpful commands! Try this:

            <blockquote style="background-color:blue; color: white; font-family:
                Consolas,monaco,monospace; padding:15px">

            CScript.exe /noLogo C:\Windows\System32\SCregEdit.wsf /cli
            </blockquote>
            Hey, don't look at me like that&mdash;remember, it was before Internet
            became available on every phone in every corner of the planet. And even
            before PowerShell got installed by default everywhere, so that you
            could rely on the familiar <em>Verb-Noun</em> naming convention to
            discover new commands on your own.
        </p>
		<p>
            But we heard the feedback loud and clear: Windows Server (and Hyper-V
            Server) needs a free, inbox <em>convenient</em> local configuration tool. This
            is how <a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/virtualization/windows-server-2008-r2-core-introducing-sconfig/ba-p/381656">SConfig
            was born</a>, debuting in Windows Server 2008 R2 and released in 2009.
            Unlike those 3rd party configuration tools, SConfig did not play
            pretend Control Panel. It had no fancy icons (or no icons whatsoever)
            and no mouse-friendly menus. It was a classic console app with
            input-driven menu. E.g. you had to type <strong>1</strong> to enter
            domain join command, or type <strong>2</strong> to rename computer, 
            and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
            SConfig tremendously helped performing initial server configuration
            tasks. This is was when customers started seriously considering
            Server Core as organization standard, not an esoteric toy. But, to be
            honest, this did not solve Server Core manageability problem completely.
            And some of those 3rd party configuration tools continued to evolve.
            In fact, <a href="https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=coreconfig">some
            of them</a> are still available, even though
            <a href="https://archive.codeplex.com/?p=corefig">archived</a> or 
            seemingly <a href="https://github.com/ejsiron/Corefig">abandoned</a>
            for quite some time.
        </p>
        <p>          
            Moreover, SConfig was written in VBScript&mdash;language which
            already turned 13 in 2009. In Windows Server 2008, PowerShell was not
            even an option because .NET Framework was not available on Server Core
            (even though there were some pretty hacky ways to install it forcibly.)
            Windows Server 2008 R2 was the first Server Core release
            to officially include .NET Framework and PowerShell. However, they
            were not installed by default back then. Quite interestingly
            <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/976736">SConfig could be 
            used</a> to install PowerShell on Server Core. So, those days 
            VBScript was the only viable option.
        </p>
        <p>            
            But this also came at cost. Part of that cost was no native support
            for localization. SConfig in any language was a completely separate
            script file. Another aspect was not so obvious but turned out a big
            deal over time. VBScrip is so old and unpopular that extending
            SConfig turned out a big challenge. In fact, nobody touched this 
            code with any improvements or modernizations for more than a decade.
            Until today.

        <h2 id="2.0">
            Introducing PowerShell-based SConfig (aka &ldquo;SConfig 2.0&rdquo;)
        </h2>
        <p>
            Windows Server kept evolving for the past 10 years. Meanwhile, SConfig
            might have seem stuck in time. But not our plans to make Server Core 
            ubiquitous and more flexible for different customer scenarios. 
            <strong>SConfig 2.0</strong> started last year as an intern project.
            The goal was to rewrite SConfig in PowerShell, effectively opening
            the door for future improvements and feature additions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now this project is almost concluded. Little known fact: SConfig feature
            was officially adopted by our awesome &ldquo;Server management
            experiences&rdquo; (SME) aka
            <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/windows-server/windows-admin-center">Windows
            Admin Center</a> (WAC) team. While we're still flushing out
            the details and fixing a few remaining bugs, the new PowerShell-based
            SConfig has finally seen the light of the day. It is available in the
            Public preview release of Azure Stack HCI. (If you have not heard of
            Azure Stack HCI recently, stop what you're doing and go read the
            <a href="http://aka.ms/AzureStackHciPreviewBlog">announcement</a>
            from Microsoft Inspire 2020.)
        </p>
        <p>
            To be clear: while SConfig has been rewritten in PowerShell from 
            ground up (no more VBscript!), this does not mean it has been transformed
            into PowerShell cmdlets. Quite the opposite: the tool's look and feel
            remains the same, familiar for those who got used to managing Server
            Core over the past decade. And while we have rather ambitious plans of
            extending its functionality, the scope of
            this preview is 1:1 feature parity with the legacy SConfig, as it
            exists today in Windows Server.

        <h2 id="Why">
            Wait, why?
        </h2>

        <p>
            If you noticed that I mentioned that SConfig is now owned by the
            Admin Center team, you may be scratching your head now: what does
            SConfig have to do with Admin Center? Isn't it an unnatural,
            artificial partnership? Doesn't SConfig compete with Admin Center
            in some sort? Should one of them fully absorb and replace the other?
            Is it yet another case where Microsoft has a &ldquo;split brain&rdquo;
            symptom and duplicates efforts because it does not know what it's doing?
        </p>

        <p>
            Well, not at all! Here's the idea. SConfig is the great <em>inbox</em>
            management too, and will always be. It has it advantages of being
            always available and lightweight, but it will never be as easy to use
            and as powerful as Admin Center. On the other hand, Admin Center is
            a great management tool which is <em>out of the box</em>. You need to
            have your server up and running, and ready for remote management in
            order to take advantage of Admin Center or any other central management
            tools that you might prefer, such as System Center.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, the job of SConfig is not to replace Admin Center (or
            vice-versa.) SConfig works best when you need to prepare a server
            for being managed remotely. This typically includes no more than five
            steps.
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Configure networking, if you are not using DHCP for some reason.
            </li>
            <li>
                Rename computer, if you're not happy with the default
                auto-generated name (understandable)
            </li>
            <li>
                Join the domain, so that you can benefit from transparent
                authentication when managing remotely and do not have to
                wrap your head around CredSSP settings and Trusted Hosts
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a domain user or security group to local Administrators
                group so that you can manage the server without having to be
                a domain admin. (Being a domain admin is a terrible, terrible
                idea)
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Maybe</em> enable remote desktop and install updates
                right away. (Note that typically you do not <em>have to</em>
                do that, as you can always do it later, when managing your
                server remotely with Admin Center, System Center and/or Group
                Policy)
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            That's all! Note that typically you do not have to enable
            remote management (WinRM) because it's enabled by default in
            all modern server operating systems. (It is disabled by
            default on Windows 10, though.) Neither you typically need
            to change Firewall rules. By default, remote access from
            <em>any subnet</em> is permitted, provided this subnet is 
            within your Active Directory boundaries. You may have to
            explicitly enable this in case you want to allow remote
            management while not being domain-joined. But remember, we
            always recommend you to join domain first&mdash;it will save
            you from a lot of headache!
        </p>

        <p>
            In fact, helping the user with these tasks is more important than 
            ever with Azure Stack HCI. Historically, Windows Server was available
            in two installation options: Server Core and Server with Desktop 
            Experience. So, inexperienced users and IT generalists would likely
            prefer Desktop Experience, while experienced admins often deployed
            Server Core. At the same time, HCI (SDDC) features in Windows Server, such
            as Storage spaces direct (S2D) and Software-defined networking (SDN)
            were only available in Datacenter edition. It made these features
            primarily targeted to large enterprise customers, sometimes leaving
            out smaller IT shops. And, by coincidence, large enterprise is where
            most of the experienced admins were employed. Now, with Azure Stack
            HCI we're trying hard to break this tradition and promote HCI/SDDC
            features to small and medium business (SMB), as well as remote offices
            and branch office (ROBO) scenarios. On the other hand, unlike Windows
            Server, Azure Stack HCI is only available in Server Core. And hence
            convenient, streamlined local experience for initial configuration 
            becomes a new critical requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, any subsequent management task, such as forming a cluster
            or joining an existing one can  (and should) be done remotely, using
            your favorite centralized management tool or maybe scripts.

            New features
        </h2>

        <p>
            Remember I told you that the scope of this release is merely feature
            parity with the legacy VBS-based SConfig? Scratch that! Of course,
            we could not release a new thing which 
            is only <em>as good as</em> the old one. And while we have to hold
            our excitement for many more new features for longer, there's still
            a couple of them available already in Azure Stack HCI today!
        </p>

        <h3 id="Default">
            Start at logon
        </h3>

        <p>
            When you log in to Windows Server, what do you see by default?
        </p>

        <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <caption>Comparing logon experience</caption>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="SConfig-03-Desktop-r.png"</td>
                <td><img src="SConfig-04-Core-r.png"</td>

                <td style="text-align: center">Server Core</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            Ouch, Server Core does not look very friendly! This minimalistic black 
            box may be ideal for hardcore IT Pros with 10 years of industry
            experience, but that's not everyone. Yes, you might know about
            SConfig&mdash;but you may very well not know about it! Or, you
            might have heard of it&mdash;but how do you use it? Rejoice, SConfig
            now starts by default when you log on!
        </p>
        <p>
            Technically, this is <em>not</em> a new feature. SConfig does start
            by default in Hyper-V Server (but not in Windows Server.) However,
            that is done slightly differently.
        </p>

        <table style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;">
            <caption>SConfig starting at logon</caption>
            <tr>
                <td><img src="SConfig-05-HVS-r.png"</td>
                <td><img src="SConfig-05-HCIpp-r.png"</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td style="text-align: center">Hyper-V Server</td>
                <td style="text-align: center">Azure Stack HCI</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            As you can see, in Hyper-V server, SConfig started as a separate 
            window. This is certainly better than no SConfig at all, but might 
            have been confusing for some. E.g. which window should I use? Why the
            other window is there? Why do they overlap? Specifically, if you are
            using server gear with a crappy KVM solution or log on locally with
            no mouse, this design was suboptimal. Now, with Azure Stack HCI,
            SConfig starts inline with command prompt window. In other words,
            SConfig is truly <strong>the new default shell</strong> for server
            management!
        </p>

        <h3 id="Shell">
            Default Shell
        </h3>

        <p>
            Speaking of command prompt window... remind me, what year it is? Is
            it CMD still being the shell? <strong>Not anymore!</strong> For the
            first time in history, the default shell on a server operating system
            is PowerShell!
        </p>
        <p>
            It might not be very obvious from the pictures, but think of it for
            a second. Given that SConfig is now written in PowerShell, it
            <em>has to run</em> in a PowerShell window! And, actually, if you 
            use option <strong>[15] Exit to command line</strong> guess where you
            will end up?
        </p>
        <p>
            <img src="SConfig-06-PowerShell-l.gif" style="display: block;
                 margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
        </p>
        <p>
            So, technically, it is PowerShell what's the default shell now. And 
            SConfig is just an app which starts automatically in the shell. But...
            this is only a part of the story.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="Selection">
            Shell selection
        </h3>

        <p>            
            Remember, PowerShell is still
            an optional component in Windows. Yes, it comes by default&mdash;but
            one can still remove it from the image, as well as from the base image.
            Who would remove PowerShell? Well, people who do not need it. And they
            might want to reduce image size even further. For example, you might
            also want to remove .NET Framework. This kind of makes sense: after
            all, it's a big chunk of code, and it also requires frequent updates.
            Worse of all, those updates are not part of OS cumulative updates. 
            So, if you feel really ascetic, you might end up removing .NET
            Framework, but this will also remove PowerShell because it depends on
            the former.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, given that PowerShell is now the default shell, we cannot
            leave anyone without any shell whatsoever. So, instead of just hard-
            coding PowerShell as the default shell unconditionally, we had to
            make the OS smarter. Now, if PowerShell is not available, it will
            fail back to the old behavior and launch CMD as the default shell!
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="SConfig-07-noPowerShell-r.gif" style="display: block;
                 margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
            <em>I had to edit this one&mdash;cut out the borign parts!</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Fun fact: in the above animation you may have noticed that removing
            PowerShell required reboot&mdash;because it was in use. In fact, we
            were using PowerShell to remove PowerShell! But adding it back did
            not require a reboot, because we had to use CMD and DISM for it.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Restart">
            Automatic restart
        </h3>

        <p>
            Have you notices something interesting in the very end of the
            previous animation? Was it surprising for you if you have use Server
            Core before? This is actually pretty cool. You may want to get back
            and watch it again. Take your time.
        </p>
        <p>
            For those who have not used Server Core before (or it's been a while),
            let me remind you. Arguably, this was the single biggest pain point
            of Server Core, especially for novice admins. Imagine you were doing
            something in the command line, but got stuck. Or you just did not 
            like it how it's going. Or you did an awkward move with your mouse. 
            Or maybe you just wanted to exit the session and thought that the
            &ldquo;exit&rdquo; command was your friend. (Spoiler alert: it was
            not.)
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="SConfig-08-Exit-r.gif" style="display: block;
                 margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
            <em>I had to capture it with actual VM window borders&mdash;otherwise
            you might not get it how miserable it gets in the end!</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            Yes, that's right. If you closed the CMD window, or exited it, or
            somehow else made it disappear you would end up with... pretty much
            nothing. Just an empty black space. Remember, there's no taskbar or
            Start menu in Server Core. So, there's nowhere to even log off.
        </p>
        <p>
            What would you do? I bet, many customers, should they found themselves
            in this unfortunate situation, would just forcibly reboot the server.
            You know, by holding the power button... Of course, there were better
            ways out of this. For instance, you could gracefully restart it
            remotely. Or open a PowerShell remoting session. Or log in as another
            user. Or... if you were really creative, you could hit Ctrl+Alt+Del
            (Ctrl+Alt+End in RDP) and use it to log off, or even summon the Task
            Manager, and use <em>it</em> to launch a new instance of CMD! But
            certainly, it would be too naiive from us to expect that level of
            trickery from an average server admin.
        </p>
        <p>
            So, Azure Stack HCI to the rescue!
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="SConfig-08-noExit-r.gif" style="display: block;
                 margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
            <em>Just remember: if you really mean to log off, you should use
            either option [12] in SConfig or type &ldquo;logoff&rdquo; in command
            line</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            As you see&mdash;no matter what you do, SConfig always gets your back!
            PowerShell restarts automatically, and SConfig pops up&mdash;as the 
            decent default shell should! (Of course, Explorer.exe does the same
            on Windows 10 and Server with Desktop Experience.)
        </p>
        <p>
            And before you ask&mdash;yes, this behavior works for when CMD is the
            default shell
            in case PowerShell is uninstalled. Just a small caveat: in this case,
            no SConfig for you! As it's a PowerShell app now, it cannot be run
            when PowerShell is not avaiable. I assume if you're so sophisticated
            that you decided to remove PowerShell, you know your ways and may 
            not need SConfig whatsoever. And if you just uninstalled PowerShell
            (or .NET Framework) by mistake you can always use DISM in CMD to
            enable it back.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Prompt">
            No more awkward prompts
        </h3>

        <p>
            Because it's now written in PowerShell, we started to give SConfig
            a major facelift. I.e. streamline it and make visually consistent and
            more pleasant to look at. This work is not done yet, but here's one 
            early move.
        </p>
        <p>            
            When using the legacy SConfig, every now and then you
            might face with some pop-up window which does not look like it belongs
            here. E.g. sometimes it was a black box asking for credentials, and
            sometimes&mdash;a GUI window with actual buttons. (Buttons? In
            <em>my</em> SConfig? No way!) I mean, they did their job, but user
            experience was suboptimal and confusing, especially over low-perf
            KVMs and lossy network connections.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="SConfig-09-Prompt-r.gif" style="display: block;
                 margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
            <em>sup</em>
        </p>

        <p>
            So, we cleaned this all up. Now all the prompts look like native
            SConfig prompts. I.e. they're displayed inline with the text.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="SConfig-10-noPrompt-r.gif" style="display: block;
                 margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" />
            <em>The only prompt that we kept standing out is the credential
            prompt. Because it's the standard secure way to prompt for credentials
            in PowerShell</em>
        </p>

        <h2 id="Future">
            SConfig futures
        </h2>

        <p>
            As you can, all the above changes were more of <em>infrastructure</em>
            improvements rather than valuable new features. While they were long
            due and absolutely necessary to lay down the foundation for future
            enhancements, I would totally understand if you're not as excited
            about them as we are.
        </p>

        <p>
            Rest assured: we do have a lot of new excitement features in the
            pipeline, and SConfig future is brighter than ever. Hopefully, we have
            proven this point so far. That said, we
            have not yet finished <em>prioritizing</em> this work, i.e. we are 
            yet to decide what to build sooner than later. So, as often with
            roadmap development, we need your help! Please let us know what

            (Maybe) top concerns and gotchas
        </h2>

        <p>
            Speaking of feedback, maybe I should have given you some heads up of
            what is knowingly different and was a deliberate choice of our team.
            It's not like we don't want to hear your feedback on these items
            (quite the opposite, in fact!)
            I just want provide some explanation in advance, so that you won't
            think it's a bug or an oversight.
        </p>

        <h3 id="noBlue">
            SConfig is not blue anymore
        </h3>
        <p>
            Yes, the legacy SConfig had a distinctive blue background. (Have you
            ever noticed it's a slightly different color from
            <a href="https://www.leeholmes.com/blog/2008/06/01/powershells-noble-blue/">PowerShell-ish
            blue</a>?)
            It may have been familiar for many of you, but we intentionally
            decided to give up on this. Given that SConfig is now the
            <em>default</em> experience, it does not have to stand apart anymore.
            Moreover, colorful backgrounds are known to cause accessibility issues.
            For these and other reasons, the modern PowerShell (née
            &ldquo;PowerShell Core&rdquo;) has now black background by default, too.
        </p>

        <p>
            Plus, it makes it easier to immediately make sure you're in the new
            SConfig and not in the legacy one.
        </p>

        <h3 id="no11">
            There's no #11 in SConfig, currently
        </h3>

        <p>
            I admit, this may seem a little weird. After <strong>[10] Telemetry
            Settings</strong> the next menu item is <strong>[12] Log off
            user</strong>. Did we simply miss a number by mistake?
        </p>

        <p>
            Not really. If you look at some of the legacy SConfig screenshots
            above, you'll see that number 11 used to be a key for Windows
            Activation. There's no OS Activation in that sense for Azure Stack
            HCI: the OS itself is a free download and free to install. (You'll
            have to <em>register</em> it with Azure, however, to start using it
            for hosting production VMs.) Hence, this menu item is not displayed.
        </p>

        <p>
            Should we just have moved the subsequent commands one step up each,
            to make 11 key for Log off, 12 for Restart, and so on? Or should we 
            have placed something new on number 11 to avoid skipping a number?
            Good questions! We seriously considered these options. However, my
            current <em>hypothesis</em> is that there are actual people out
            there who got used to the old SConfig in the past years. They may
            have developed muscle memory around one or more of these keys. And 
            if true, those people won't appreciate that if we suddenly moved their
            cheese. E.g. if I got a habit of pressing 12 to Log off, I would not
            be amused if suddenly it becomes a key for Restart, and so on.
        </p>

        <p>
            Am I right? Am I wrong? Was skipping the number the best decision?
            We honestly do not know yet, and that's one of the points of writing 
            this post. We look forward for your feedback and opinions on this, 
            among other things.

        <h2 id="Known">
            Known issues in SConfig in Azure Stack HCI public preview (build 
            17784.1068)
        </h2>

        <p>
            As I said couple times already, the new SConfig in Azure Stack HCI
            public preview is our early take. By no means we believe it's feature
            complete or bugs free. In fact, we're already aware of some of the
            rather unfortunate issues in the current build. Remember, it's a preview
            release, so we have a plan of fixing all of these issues in the coming
            months. But worth noting anyway, especially if you feel stuck or angry
            with us.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Telemetry">
            All languages: Telemetry says &ldquo;Unknown&rdquo; 
            by default
        </h3>

        <p>
            In fact, this is not a new issue. SConfig had always behaved this way.
            But I understand it's quite confusing, especially around such
            delicate topic as data collection and privacy. So wanted to call it out
            anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you install any operating system, the default telemetry level
            applies, unless you have changed it. The default for Windows Server
            is <strong>Enhanced,</strong> while the default for Azure Stack HCI
            is <strong>Security only.</strong> However, SConfig will show it as
            &ldquo;Unknown.&rdquo; If you change the telemetry level (using 
            SConfig or otherwise, e.g. via Group Policy), SConfig will show you
            the actual value.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Subnet mask">
            All languages: Cannot set static IP address when accepting default
            value for Subnet mask
        </h3>

        <p>
            If you use SConfig to set up static IP address assignment to one of
            the network adapters, it will offer you a convenient default value
            for Subnet mask (which is &ldquo;255.255.255.0&rdquo; or /24.) The 
            problem is, it does not currently read this value properly, and the 
            whole operation fails silently. Effectively, the IP address is not
            being set.
        </p>
        <p> 
            To work around this issue, always type in the Subnet
            mask explicitly, even if you mean to set it to the same value 
            (255.255.255.0.)
        </p>

        <h3 id="DNS Server">
            All languages: DNS Servers may not be displayed
        </h3>

        <p>
            In the same network settings area, SConfig shows you what DNS servers
            have been configured. Except when it does not. That is, sometimes
            this list is empty, even though the DNS Servers are configured
            correctly.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a workaround, if DNS Servers are not displayed, or the values do
            not match what you expect them to be, check the actual settings by
            typing
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/dnsclient/get-dnsclientserveraddress">
                Get-DnsClientServerAddress
            </a>
            in PowerShell.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Rename">
            All languages: Cannot rename computer using non-Latin characters
        </h3>

        <p>
            When using option <strong>[2] Computer name,</strong> you cannot 
            define a new computer name using non-Latin characters, such as
            Cyrillic or Asian symbols. Anything except A-Z, numbers and hyphen
            is not allowed. This behavior is consistent with
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/rename-computer?view=powershell-5.1">
            Rename-Computer</a> cmdlet.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a workaround, you may use the old 
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/cc788029(v=ws.11)">
            Netdom</a> utility in PowerShell.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Remote management">
            All languages, except English: Remote management value is shown as
            &ldquo;Disabled&rdquo;
        </h3>

        <p>
            As I noted before, Remote management is always enabled by default,
            unless disabled e.g. by Group Policy. However, in non-English
            versions, SConfig fails to display it correctly and fails back to 
            showing &ldquo;Disabled.&rdquo; This happens even after you use
            SConfig to configure and enable it again. No matter what you do,
            it will always say it's disabled.
        </p>

        <p>
            There are no workarounds, just be aware that remote management is in
            fact enabled, and use it as you would normally do. If something
            does not work, try running
            <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/enable-psremoting?view=powershell-5.1">Enable-psRemoting</a>
            in PowerShell and take action on any errors or warnings returned by this
            cmdlet.
        </p>

        <h3 id="Localized prompt">
            All languages, except English: the key prompts ask you for localized
            input, but expect English input in fact
        </h3>

        <p>
            This is a very unfortunate one. Imagine you've installed Azure Stack
            HCI in French, and Logoff prompt ask you for confirmation: 
            <em>(O)ui ou (N)on</em>. Or, the same in German: <em>(J)a oder
            (n)ein</em>. So, naturally you should press <strong>O</strong> (in 
            French) or <strong>J</strong> (in German) to confirm. However, this
            does not work. In fact, you have to press <strong>Y</strong> (for 
            English <em>Yes)</em> to proceed. This applies to any prompts
            displayed by SCconfig. You always have to use the keys which
            correspond to English text.
        </p>

        <p>
            Unfortunately, there's no easy workaround today. You may either use 
            English version of Azure Stack HCI for testing, and install a language
            pack later if you prefer a localized user interface. Or quit SConfig
            for now and use PowerShell to configure your servers. (Remember, 
            everything SCofnig does, PowerShell does too&mdash;and much more!)

            Given the previous issue, it may not be a very bad thing. But anyway,
            Azure Stack HCI preview is currently available in 12 languages&mdash;
            which are the same languages Azure portal is available in. Five
            of them ship with localized SConfig. However, there are seven 
            languages currently where SConfig is not yet localized. All user
            interface is in English. Here's the list of these languages.

        <h2 id="Windows Server">
            Last but not least: SConfig in Windows Server
        </h2>

        <p>
            This is all great, but are we going to abandon Windows Server and 
            leave it in the limb forever with the legacy SConfig? Absolutely not!
            We <strong>love</strong> Windows Server. It is true that Azure Stack
            HCI did receive some exclusive new features that differentiate it
            from Windows Server, and there will be many more. But SConfig is not
            intended to be one of them! It's just that new SConfig
            is not quite ready for prime time yet (as you can probably tell from
            the list of known issues above.) Our plan is to use Azure Stack
            HCI as our vehicle for rapid release, flush out all the details and
            gather feedback. But the new SConfig will be part of Server Core in
            the upcoming releases of Windows Server.
