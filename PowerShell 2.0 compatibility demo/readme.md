This is a simple demo that shows how legacy code may behavie differently in PowerShell 2.0 vs. later versions.

Guidance
1. Copy the `Script` contents to the target machine.
1. Build the solution.
1. Place the resulting `PowerShell 2.0 compatibility demo.dll` alongside with the scripts.
1. Run the `My Legacy Script 01.ps1`..`My Legacy Script 03.ps1` in different versions of PowerShell to observe the differences in behavior.
